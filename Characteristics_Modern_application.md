# Characteristics of a Modern Web Application

## Overview
Modern web applications must be available 24/7, operate on various devices and screen sizes, and handle complex scenarios efficiently. Key characteristics include adaptability, security, scalability, and a strong user experience (UX) utilizing JavaScript and web APIs.

## Main Characteristics

### Cloud Hosting
- **Seamless Cloud Integration**: Ensures dependable operations and scalability to meet demand.
- **App Resilience**: Ability to maintain operations despite failures, enhancing UX by preserving data and state through breakdowns.

### Cross-Platform Usability
- **Platform Independence**: Apps should run on multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Windows) without compromising UX.
- **Unified Development**: Using different programming languages for each platform can cause inconsistency. Cross-platform development solves this by providing a seamless and smooth user experience across devices.
- **Enhanced Engagement**: Users can switch between devices (e.g., from a laptop to a mobile) while maintaining a consistent experience.

### Traditional and SPA Behaviors Supported
- **Traditional Applications**: Treat each user process as a new request, leading to slower performance due to full page reloads.
- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**: Execute specific areas without reloading the entire app, resulting in faster performance and a smoother user experience.
- **Hybrid Apps**: Combine traditional and SPA behaviors to optimize performance and UX.

## Agile Methods and Architecture
- **Agile Development**: Iterative and incremental approach allowing flexibility in requirements and quick adaptation.
- **Minimal Viable Architecture**: Initial architecture supports core features and is refined over iterations.
- **Responding to Change**: Agile methods prioritize adaptability to changing requirements, ensuring continuous improvement and user feedback integration.
- **Documentation**: Focus on working software over comprehensive documentation. Significant architectural documentation is created only when necessary.

## What Happens When Requirements Change?
- **Adapting to Change**: Agile emphasizes responding to changes, even during iterations, affecting design decisions and productivity temporarily.
- **Minor Adjustments**: Major architectural decisions remain stable, with minor tweaks to accommodate evolving requirements.

## Documenting Architecture in Agile
- **Focus on Deliverables**: Main deliverable is working software, with necessary documentation created to align stakeholders.
- **Stakeholder Discussions**: Engage with stakeholders to determine the importance of documentation, ensuring it adds value to the deliverables.
