# Agile Methods in Software Development

## Agile vs. Waterfall
- **Agile methods** are iterative and incremental, unlike the sequential waterfall model.
- In Agile, there is no assumption that requirements are final before moving to the next phase.

## Agile Manifesto
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

## Key Features of Agile
- Focus on rapid deliverables, typically within 2-3 weeks (iterations).
- Plans evolve quickly and can change even during an iteration.

## Architecture in Agile
- Initial iterations can start with thinking about software architecture, leaving room for unknown requirements.
- Agile focuses on building a minimal, viable architecture that supports initial features and can be modified as the project evolves.
- Architectural work items are added to the project/product backlog and iteration backlog.
- Architecture is developed incrementally, not fully defined upfront.
- Design decisions throughout iterations contribute to the emergent architecture.
- No specific phase or iteration is dedicated solely to architecture design.

## Handling Changing Requirements
- Agile prioritizes "responding to change over following a plan."
- Changes in requirements lead to changes in relevant design decisions.
- Though more work and lower productivity may result temporarily, major architectural decisions typically remain stable.

## Documenting Architecture in Agile
- Agile prioritizes "working software over comprehensive documentation."
- Documentation is important but should not overshadow the development of working software.
- Documentation should be significant enough to warrant the time spent, based on stakeholder discussions.
- Stakeholders must be convinced of the value of thorough documentation for it to be included in deliverables.

## Conclusion
By focusing on flexibility, adaptability, and rapid development cycles, Agile methods aim to create a robust foundation that evolves with the project and incorporates feedback and changes efficiently.
